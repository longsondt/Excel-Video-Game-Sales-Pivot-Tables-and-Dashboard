## Introduction
The goal of this project is to demonstrate experience in working with Excel Tables and Pivot Tables, and creating an interactive dashboard for the user. The dataset used
in the project is about video game sales of 16,5000 games from 1980 to 2017. With 11 different columns, like release year, genre, and sales, the dataset provides ample 
possibilites to demonstrate summarize and visualize data in a meaningful and digestible way.

The dashboard displays visualizations of Pivot Tables data and allows users to interact with them with slicers. For example, choosing a specific year, along with a different platform and publisher will change the data context and visualizations.
